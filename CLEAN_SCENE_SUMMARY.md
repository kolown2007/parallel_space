# Clean Scene Integration Summary

## What was accomplished:

✅ **Created Clean Scene Architecture as Scene 5**

### 1. Scene Components Created:
- **SimpleScene.ts** - Object-oriented Babylon.js scene with direct mesh manipulation
- **CleanScene.ts** - Entity Component System (ECS) using bitECS for scalable architecture  
- **CleanSceneWrapper.ts** - Wrapper to integrate both scenes with the SceneManager
- **components.ts** - ECS components (Transform, Mesh, Camera, Torus)

### 2. Integration with Main Page:
- Added clean scene as **Scene 5** (press '5' key)
- Integrated with existing SceneManager system
- Added dedicated canvas for clean scenes
- Updated visibility management and random scene selection

### 3. Scene Features:
- **Both scenes show animated rotating torus**
- **Mouse controls**: Rotate camera, zoom with wheel
- **Toggle between architectures**: Press 'T' to switch Simple ↔ ECS
- **Visual notifications** when switching scene types

### 4. Architecture Comparison:

#### SimpleScene (Object-Oriented)
```typescript
// Direct Babylon.js usage
const torus = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateTorus(...);
torus.rotation.y += deltaTime;
```

#### CleanScene (ECS)
```typescript
// Component-based architecture
addComponent(world, Transform, entity);
addComponent(world, Mesh, entity);
// System updates entities with components
```

## How to Use:

1. **Start the dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:5173/
3. **Switch to clean scene**: Press '5' key
4. **Toggle scene types**: Press 'T' to switch between Simple/ECS
5. **Mouse controls**: Drag to rotate, wheel to zoom

## Scene Switching Keys:
- **1** - Wormhole Scene (complex 3D)
- **2** - DOM Scene  
- **3** - Video Scene
- **4** - Flow Scene
- **5** - Clean Scene (Simple/ECS toggle with 'T')

## Benefits:

### SimpleScene Benefits:
- ✅ Easy to understand and modify
- ✅ Direct Babylon.js API access
- ✅ Quick prototyping
- ✅ Perfect for simple scenes

### CleanScene Benefits:  
- ✅ Scalable architecture for complex games
- ✅ Data-oriented design
- ✅ Reusable component system
- ✅ Better performance for many entities

This provides a **Phaser-style** intuitive architecture that's easy to edit and understand, addressing the original request for cleaner, more maintainable code structure.
